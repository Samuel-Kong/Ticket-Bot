### What I Learned

Working on Ticket-Bot provided valuable insights into several areas of software development and bot creation:

- **Disnake Library**: Gained hands-on experience with the Disnake library for building Discord bots, including event handling and API integration.
- **Python Programming**: Improved Python skills, particularly in object-oriented programming and asynchronous programming.
- **Bot Configuration**: Learned how to create and manage configuration files for customizable bot settings.
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced understanding of debugging and handling exceptions to ensure smooth bot operation.
- **AI Integration**: Explored the integration of AI models to enhance bot functionality and user experience.
- **Version Control**: Strengthened Git skills by managing the project repository and collaborating effectively.

This project was a great opportunity to apply and expand my knowledge in building practical applications with Python and AI.
